# Product Overview

Spec Driven Codex provides a specification-driven workflow packaged as a Node.js CLI. The tool scaffolds the `.sdd/` workspace inside any project so teams can capture product steering notes, requirements, designs, tasks, and implementation records in a consistent structure aligned with the Codex CLI prompts.

# Key Capabilities

- Bootstrap the `.sdd/` directory with localized templates and documentation through the `init` command.
- Refresh Codex CLI prompt files and the `.sdd/README.md` on demand via the `upgrade` command.
- Maintain safe re-runs that keep existing prompt files intact while updating shared guidance.
- Ship locale-aware resources, currently supporting English and Japanese assets.

# Target Use Cases

- Teams adopting the Codex CLI who need a repeatable way to capture specification artifacts.
- Individual developers who want lightweight guardrails for discovery-to-delivery workflows.
- Projects that periodically refresh prompt templates to stay aligned with the latest guidance.

# Value Proposition

Spec Driven Codex reduces setup time for specification-driven development, keeps documentation artifacts synchronized with Codex prompts, and enforces a predictable structure so engineers can focus on implementation while preserving traceability from steering through archival.
