# Specification-Driven Development: Design

Translate the approved requirements into an actionable technical plan.

## Step 1: Review Requirements
Quickly revisit `.sdd/specs/<spec-name>/requirements.md` and ensure all questions are resolved. If not, loop back to `/sdd-requirements`.

## Step 2: Architecture & Approach
Discuss and document:
- System boundaries and data flow
- Chosen patterns, libraries, or frameworks
- Alternative approaches considered and why they were rejected

## Step 3: Risks & Mitigations
List the main technical risks, ambiguity, or debt and how you plan to mitigate them.

## Step 4: Deliverables
Create `.sdd/specs/<spec-name>/design.md` covering:
- Architecture overview (diagrams optional)
- Data models or API contracts
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Deployment or migration considerations

Ensure the team agrees on the design before moving to `/sdd-tasks`.
