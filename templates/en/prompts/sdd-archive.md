# Specification-Driven Development: Archive

Wrap up the specification by recording outcomes, metrics, and lessons learned.

## Step 1: Validate Completion
Confirm that the requirements, design, and tasks documents reflect the final state. Note any deviations from the original plan.

## Step 2: Summarize Results
Document:
- What was delivered and how it meets the goals
- Test evidence and rollout status
- Remaining follow-up work or new specs to open

## Step 3: Retrospective Notes
Capture insights such as:
- What went well
- What was challenging
- Suggestions to improve the next iteration

## Step 4: File and Organize
Move the completed spec under `.sdd/specs/archives/<date>-<spec-name>/`. Ensure all artifacts are checked in and easy to discover.

Thank everyone involved and surface any outstanding risks to stakeholders.
